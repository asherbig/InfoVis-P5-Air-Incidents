Which airports are the most dangerous?

Can I plot it as dots on a map of the earth?

Assuming you get into an incident, what's the best make to be in?
  %injured - find the lowest
  %dead - find the lowest

Graph of all crashes over time
x=time
y=injuries? fatalities? injuries + fatalities? 
on hover, display date, injuries, and fatalities, and maybe accident number?
