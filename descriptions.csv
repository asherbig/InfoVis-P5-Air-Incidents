"Air Incident Casualties Over Time","Fatal incidents seem prevalant over time.","Is there any general trend over time? We can tell the frequency of fatal incidents has not gone down, and that fatal incidents contribute almost all of the casualties on the graph. In fact, most non-fatal incidents seem to have between 1 and 5 injuries. However, it looks like an awful lot of incidents here are fatal."
"Number of Incidents by Incident Severity","Fatal incidents aren't actually that common!","How common is a fatal air incident? Fatal incidents are the smallest category, with under half the number of Non-Fatal incidents. As it turns out, most incidents don't even have injuries! You've probably noticed by hovering over the fatal incidents, that some are not 100% fatal. Let's break that down a little bit."
"Breakdown of Fatal Incidents Over Time","Fatal incidents aren't 100% fatal.","Looking over time, we can see how safe trends emerged. Between 2006 and 2008, there were lots of flights that although had some fatalities, were generally safe incidents. However, looking at recent data since 2012, we see that the incidents are much less forgiving. We also see that the majority of fatal incidents are mostly fatal, if not completely fatal. Then we have other incidents that are mostly non-fatal, with only a few fatalities. There aren't many that aren't one extreme or the other."
"Breakdown of Injury Causing Incidents","Non-Fatal incidents follow the same trends as fatal incidents.","We see the same type of trend in the non-Fatal incidents as the fatal incidents, with a some highs and some low percentages of people injured, but not much inbetween. Most of the higher injury counts also have a low percentage of injury. This is probably because a crash with a high percentage of injured individuals is also very likely to have a fatality out of 100+ people. Hovering over the dots reveals more data about each incident, including number of people involved."
